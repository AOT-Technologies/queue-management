# Designed to be called by cron on a regular basis to heal the Redis cluster in
# the event of restart of all pods. To keep the code as simple as possible, it
# does a CLUSTER MEET every time it is called, even if the cluster is complete.
#
# Arguments are:
#
#  - Name of the statefulset, such as "redis-theq". This script relies on pods
#    being named "redis-theq-0" through "redis-theq-5"
#  - Hostname of the Redis service, such as "$REDIS_THEQ_SERVICE_HOST"
#  - Port number of the Redis service, such as "$REDIS_THEQ_SERVICE_PORT"
#  - Password for authenticating to the Redis nodes, such as the "password"
#    value in the "redis-theq-secret" secret.
